# dartpad_ui

The UI client for a web based interactive Dart service.

## What is it? What does it do?

This project is a web based interactive Dart service. It's meant to be a simple,
easy way for users to play with Dart on-line, in a zero-install, zero
configuration environment. It'll support an easy snippet sharing service.

## Project status

Pre-alpha! Definitely still a work in progress.
